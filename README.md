This is an early version of VR application developed by AGH DynamiX for presentation purposes. The aim of our project is to create custom VR controllers for rehabilitation. Controllers should be capable of measuring various parameters of human body and passing them as an input for smartphone/computer application which creates a series of tasks and excersises for the user. To try our app download IRB2600VR_ver1.exe file. To open the project in Unity download all files in repository, place them in one folder and open it as Unity project.
